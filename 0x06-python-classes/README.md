# Object Oriented Programming Project

This project explores the concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It covers fundamental concepts such as classes, objects, attributes, methods, and encapsulation.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- All modules should have a documentation
- All classes should have a documentation
- All functions should have a documentation
- Code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)

## Resources

- [Object Oriented Programming](#) - Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” excluded.
